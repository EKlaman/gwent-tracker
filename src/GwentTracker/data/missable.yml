    notes:
        - If you leave the vicinity of Passiflora the quest will fail. Do not start the quest if you are unsure of winning the gwent matches. You will not be able to go and get more cards If you already signed up for the tournament.
        - Consider finishing the Old Pals and Big City Players quests to build a stronger deck before doing this quest.
        - You must win the tournament to get every card. Recommend saving before each game.
        - Save between wins. This quest is the only way to obtain all leader cards.
        - Sasha is the toughest opponent with her Nilfgaardian deck. She plays a very strong spy-themed deck which is also filled with high-strength unit cards and an entire roster of Nilfgaard and neutral heroes. Counter her with a lot of decoys and spy cards; keep the unit cards in the deck as close to 22 as possible and with the highest possible unit strength. The White Flame leader card is useful for countering her unique leader card which draws a unit card from the player's discard pile for her own use. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED players make a save if they wish to win the tournament outright, otherwise Sasha beats Tybalt in the final round. She can be romanced if Geralt agrees to her proposition.
