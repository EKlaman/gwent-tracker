## Installation

This application doesn't require any installation. It's a standalone executable.

1. Download archive for your operating system
2. Extract - On windows, right click file and select extract. On linux, use your systems archive manager or `ï»¿unzip`
3. Run the executable named _GwentTracker_


## Usage

The application will load the latest save in your save game directory. It will also watch that directory for changes so you can leave the app open as you play and it will automatically update.

All column headers are sortable (including the checkbox column). You can `Shift+Click` column headers to sort by more one than one column at a time.

You may use the filter text box to narrow down the cards that are shown. For example, typing _velen_ into the textbox and clicking the add button will only show cards with the word velen in their name, deck, type, location or region.

## Settings

Settings are in the file named `settings.ini`. You likely won't need to change any of these if you have a default installation of The Witcher 3.

## Runtime Prerequisites
#### Windows
* [.Net Framework 4.7.2 runtime] (Likely already installed if you have an up-to-date OS)
* For windows 7 users, you'll need the [platform update]

#### Linux
* [.Net Core 3.1 Runtime]

  There are two versions of the application. Both depend on the .net core runtime. 
  One requires you to have the runtime installed on your machine and the other 
  has it pre-bundled with the application. If you have the runtime installed or
  are willing to install it, download the release without the _runtime_ tag in 
  the filename.

* GTK3 has to be installed in the system or be available from LD_LIBRARY_PATH
